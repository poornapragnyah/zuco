Here's a refined pipeline that incorporates the most relevant suggestions for enhancing the EEG-to-video framework with RAG integration:

### Refined Pipeline

#### Step 1: EEG Preprocessing
- Import Data: Load EEG files into a processing environment like EEGLAB.
- Channel Alignment: Ensure all channels are correctly positioned and referenced.
- Filtering: Apply band-pass filters (e.g., 1-30 Hz) to focus on relevant frequency bands.
- Bad Channel Detection: Identify and interpolate noisy channels.
- ICA (Independent Component Analysis): Use ICA for better artifact removal, especially for eye blinks and muscle movements.
- Adaptive Filtering: Implement adaptive filtering techniques to handle varying signal quality during longer recordings.
- Standardization: Apply z-scoring or quantile normalization to standardize data across subjects.

#### Step 2: EEG2Text Decoding
- Feature Extraction: Use techniques like covariance matrices or deep learning encoders to extract features from EEG data.
- Text Generation: Train a model (e.g., CET-MAE) to predict text based on these features.
- Multi-Task Learning: Incorporate multi-task learning to jointly predict different semantic aspects (objects, actions, emotions).
- Attention Mechanisms: Add attention mechanisms to focus on EEG channels/timepoints most relevant for specific semantic categories.
- Subject-Specific Fine-Tuning: Implement subject-specific fine-tuning to account for individual differences in brain activity patterns.

#### Step 3: RAG Integration
- Knowledge Base Construction: Index a large text corpus (e.g., Chisco dataset) to create a retrieval system.
- Query and Retrieve: Use EEG-derived text as queries to retrieve relevant concepts from the knowledge base.
- Fusion Layer: Combine retrieved information with EEG2Text outputs to enhance semantic accuracy.
- Hierarchical Retrieval: Use hierarchical retrieval with multiple granularity levels (general concepts â†’ specific details).
- Contextual Weighting: Add contextual weighting to prioritize retrieved information based on EEG confidence scores.

#### Step 4: Dynamic Video Generation
- Video Diffusion Model: Use a model like NEVER to generate frames based on text inputs.
- Temporal Coherence: Apply temporal coherence loss to ensure smooth video transitions.
- Semantic Consistency: Align video content with EEG-derived semantic information.
- EEG-Guided Attention: Implement EEG-guided attention to focus video generation on aspects with stronger neural signals.
- Style Control Parameters: Add style control parameters derived from emotional or attentional EEG signatures.

#### Step 5: Performance Evaluation
- Visual Inspection: Check for coherence and relevance.
- Quantitative Metrics: Use metrics like SSIM and CLIP-pcc to evaluate video quality and semantic alignment.
- Subjective Evaluation: Add subjective evaluation where subjects rate how well the video matches their mental imagery.
- Neurophysiological Validation: Implement neurophysiological validation by measuring brain responses to generated videos.
